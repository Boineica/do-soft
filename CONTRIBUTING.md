# Before contributing, here are some important stuff

You have gone here huh? Well, let's get started.

## Issues

If you want to contribute, it is very important to go a bit techy. Since do-soft is an OS and not a website, others will just ignore you and say "Oh, thats well? This is an Operating system." 

## Goals

IF you want to contribute, you might as well know our goals; to start simple and end complex. Do not contribute code that you only, not the community, want; there might be code related to it; or even an issue related to your issue.

## Conclusion

Well, this is not complete; you can also contribute this file, have fun! ðŸ˜ƒ
